Hello

I'm writing this message at 1:05 pm due to this fucking project.
There are implementations of dynamic blinking and almost ideal bounce protection.
By the way, this is the first quite serious project on stm_32 kernel for me.

Yeah, to use this project (i dont know why are you trying to use it) you should find seven segment display and connect it correctly.
The connection diagram is in this folder too.
